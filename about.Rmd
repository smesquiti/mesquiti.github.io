## A little about me!

I am currently a lab manager and research coordinator for the [Communication Neuroscience lab](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/research/centers/communication-neuroscience-lab) housed in the Annenberg School Communication at the University of Pennsylvania for [Dr. Emily Falk](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/people/faculty/emily-falk-phd).


Prior to Penn, I was fortunate enough to play D3 college lacrosse at Southwestern University in Georgetown, TX where I received a B.A. in Psychology and met some of my best friends. My experiences on the lacrosse field got me into this whole research 'thing' :).


After SU, I went on to earn my Master's in Psychological Research from Texas State University, where I studied the implications that [motivation had on student-athlete's subjective well-being](https://digital.library.txstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10877/15608/MESQUITI-THESIS-2022.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y). In addition to my Master's Program I also worked in Dr. Jamie Pennebaker's [lab](https://www.words.live/) as a research assistant on LIWC-22 with Drs. [Sarah Seraj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahseraj/) and [Kate Blackburn](https://www.kateblackburn.us/) - some of the coolest people ever! Working in Jamie's lab also transformed the way I think about studying psychology. That is, what can subtle shifts in one's language tell us about any individual's psychology (e.g., motivation, thinking, focus, etc.)?


## Current work

I am currently interested in questions like:

**How does the way people talk about their goals influence their ability to complete them and consequently their well-being?**

**How does this vary within-person and between people?**

As an aspiring research, I am interested in exploring said topics and using language analysis as a tool to gain insights on between and within-person variability in goal pursuit and well-being. In the past, I've studied things like cross-cultural differences in prosocial lying and the impact of social upheavals on business executives' decision making.
