## A little about me!

I am currently a PhD Student in the [Logic of Emotion Lab at Princeton University](https://lemolab.princeton.edu/) advised by Erik Nook. I am broadly interested in questions like: does the language that people use to communicate their thoughts, feelings, and beliefs grant us insights into shifts in their emotions, unique life experiences, and well-being?

Before Princeton, lab manager and research coordinator for the [Communication Neuroscience lab](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/research/centers/communication-neuroscience-lab) housed in the Annenberg School Communication at the University of Pennsylvania for [Dr. Emily Falk](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/people/faculty/emily-falk-phd). I am also lucky that Emily loaned me out to collaborate with researchers [Angela Duckworth](https://angeladuckworth.com/), [Lyle Ungar](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~ungar/), and [Mark Liberman](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~myl/) on projects using computational linguistics and social science.

Prior to Penn, I was fortunate enough to play D3 college lacrosse at Southwestern University in Georgetown, TX where I received a B.A. in Psychology and met some of my best friends.

After SU, I went on to earn my Master's in Psychological Research from Texas State University, where I studied the implications that [motivation had on student-athlete's subjective well-being](https://digital.library.txstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10877/15608/MESQUITI-THESIS-2022.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y). In addition to my Master's Program, I also worked in Dr. Jamie Pennebaker's [lab](https://www.words.live/) as a research assistant on LIWC-22 with Dr. [Sarah Seraj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahseraj/). Working in Jamie's lab also transformed the way I think about studying psychology and science more broadly. That is, what can subtle shifts in one's language tell us about any individual's psychology (e.g., motivation, thinking, focus, etc.)?
